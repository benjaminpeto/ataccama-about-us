# Ataccama - About us - Landing Page

The project was made by strictly following a design [brief](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9dbc5226-af39-47f6-95cd-f92d26446c5c-c8ef/). The code has been written for a screensize of 1920 x 1080. The main goal of the project was showing off my creativity through micro animations, and focus mainly on the SVG which connects those 4 boxes.

For bonus, I have added animations through the whole website, and applied hover effects on anchor links, buttons, and the Card components.

## DEMO

## !!! Not for deployment !!!

I have used Greensock animation library from npm as gsap-trial, which included extra plugins such as DrawSVGPlugin which currently only available for Club Members. For that reason this landing page only can run in local environment or CodePen.

### Stack & dependecies
